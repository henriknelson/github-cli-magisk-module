.SH NAME
.PP
gh\-pr\-create \- Create a pull request


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBgh pr create [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Create a pull request on GitHub.

.PP
When the current branch isn't fully pushed to a git remote, a prompt will ask where
to push the branch and offer an option to fork the base repository. Use '\-\-head' to
explicitly skip any forking or pushing behavior.

.PP
A prompt will also ask for the title and the body of the pull request. Use '\-\-title'
and '\-\-body' to skip this, or use '\-\-fill' to autofill these values from git commits.
