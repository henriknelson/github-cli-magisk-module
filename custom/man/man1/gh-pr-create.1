.SH NAME
.PP
gh\-pr\-create \- Create a pull request


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBgh pr create [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Create a pull request on GitHub.

.PP
When the current branch isn't fully pushed to a git remote, a prompt will ask where
to push the branch and offer an option to fork the base repository. Use \fB\fC\-\-head\fR to
explicitly skip any forking or pushing behavior.

.PP
A prompt will also ask for the title and the body of the pull request. Use \fB\fC\-\-title\fR
and \fB\fC\-\-body\fR to skip this, or use \fB\fC\-\-fill\fR to autofill these values from git commits.

.PP
Link an issue to the pull request by referencing the issue in the body of the pull
request. If the body text mentions \fB\fCFixes #123\fR or \fB\fCCloses #123\fR, the referenced issue
will automatically get closed when the pull request gets merged.

.PP
By default, users with write access to the base respository can push new commits to the
head branch of the pull request. Disable this with \fB\fC\-\-no\-maintainer\-edit\fR\&.
